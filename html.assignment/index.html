            <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
            <p>My full name is Victoire Intwali Igisubizo, but I prefer Vicky Intwali. I was born and raised in Rwanda. “East Africa”. I moved to Canada when I was 12 years old with my family. It was not an easy transition, leaving my friends, country, and my home that I had known all my life, but I did. Over the years in Canada, I have learned that it is possible to start over again, to make new friends, and to call another place home. Lastly, I have learned that you have power to make it the best experience of your life if you choose it to be. </p>

            <h2><strong>What Do I Enjoy Doing ?</strong></h2>
            <p> One of the many things I enjoy doing is hanging out with my family, dancing, taking pictures for my modelling portfolio and painting. As a young girl I always dreamed of being a model. I did not think it was possible until I moved to Canada. There was a lot of opportunities that presented themselves to me and a lot of modelling agencies compared to my country. The more I saw opportunities, the more I realized it was something I wanted to do with all my heart. </p>
